[Get conversations SQL query](messages/get_conversations.php): 

**Prompt:** 

(pasted the current schema.sql file first, it's in db/init/schema.sql), given the above schema can you help me craft a SQL query that will return all conversations for a given user, timestamps and their unseen status.

**Output:**

SELECT m.conversation_id,
CASE WHEN m.sender_id = ? THEN u2.user_name ELSE u1.user_name END AS other_name,
COALESCE(MAX(cm.sent_at), m.start_date) AS last_message_time,
CASE
WHEN m.receiver_id = ? THEN m.unseen
ELSE m.unseen_2
END AS unseen
FROM Messages m
JOIN Users u1 ON u1.id = m.sender_id
JOIN Users u2 ON u2.id = m.receiver_id
LEFT JOIN ChatMessages cm ON cm.conversation_id = m.conversation_id
WHERE m.sender_id = ? OR m.receiver_id = ?
GROUP BY m.conversation_id, other_name, m.start_date, m.unseen, m.unseen_2
ORDER BY last_message_time DESC;

[SQL queries to support complex search weighting and filtering](inc/functions.php):

**Prompt:** 

(pasted the current schema.sql file first, it's in db/init/schema.sql), I want to build a PHP functions that performs an advanced search through my Listings table, ranking results by how relevant the title/description are to a term and by popularity (likes – dislikes). How should I write the SQL for that?

**Output:**

You can achieve that by combining a CASE expression (for relevance scoring) with a popularity metric and a simple ORDER BY.

**Prompt:**

(pasted the current schema.sql file first, it's in db/init/schema.sql), I also have an Availability table linked by listing_id. Could we adapt the same search so it only returns listings available on a given day and within a start/end time window?

**Output:**

Perfect use case for a JOIN — you can connect your listings to their availability slots and add time-based filters.

> Note that all these queries involve pasting the schema.sql file in to save room I didn't paste that in here for each time.
