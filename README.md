# Full-Stack Marketplace Platform

A full-stack web application for listing, discovering, and booking peer-to-peer services, built with a focus on practical backend architecture, data modelling, and end-to-end system flow.

This repository represents my **independently maintained version** of a larger team project, refactored and structured for clarity, maintainability, and portfolio presentation.

---

## Overview

The platform enables users to:
- Create and manage service listings
- Browse and search available services
- Request and book services through a structured workflow
- Manage user accounts and role-based actions

The project was designed to mirror a real marketplace system rather than a purely academic exercise, with attention paid to backend logic, data consistency, and separation of concerns.

## Tech Stack

**Backend**
- PHP
- SQL (relational database design)
- Server-side validation and session management

**Frontend**
- HTML / CSS
- JavaScript (client-side interactions)

**Infrastructure & Tooling**
- Git / GitHub
- MVC-style project structure
- Environment-based configuration

---

## Architecture Notes

- Clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data access layers
- Normalised database schema with explicit relationships
- Defensive input validation on both client and server
- Designed to be deployable on standard LAMP-style environments

---

## My Contributions & Focus

While the original project was developed in a team setting, this version reflects my **personal work and understanding** of the system, including:

- Backend feature implementation and refactoring
- Database schema design and query optimisation
- Application flow and state management
- Project restructuring for readability and maintainability
- Documentation and cleanup for long-term ownership

This repository is intentionally maintained as a **standalone codebase** to demonstrate my individual technical skills.

## Future Improvements

If extended further, I would:
- Introduce authentication hardening and role-based access control
- Add pagination and filtering for scalability
- Improve error handling and logging
- Containerise the application for reproducible deployment
- Add automated tests for core business logic

## Disclaimer

This project originated as part of a university team assignment.  
This repository is a **personal, independently managed version** created for learning, refinement, and portfolio purposes.
