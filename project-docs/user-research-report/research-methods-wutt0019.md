# User Research Methods 
****
This section will contain a variety of user research methods that will be used to help the development team gain a deeper understanding of our target user groups.
Our goal is to have a variety of research methods that can be used at different stages of the development lifecycle in order to be constantly taking on user feedback and using that feedback to make valuable improvements and features.

## User Interviews
User interviews will give us the opportunity to have one-on-ones with users and really probe for specifics, general opinions, and engage in an open-ended conversation about the overall user needs, wants and pains.
Interviews do have their drawbacks, depending on whether they're conducted in person or not can really change the kinds of answers and how we may interpret them.
This is why we believe in conducting in-person interviews to try and truly gage the users emotions and attitudes about FUSS and how we can accommodate them with the best user experience possible.
We believe this process will take somewhere around a month in total given by:
- 1-2 weeks for planning.
- 1 week to conduct the interviews.
- 1 week to compile and interpret results.

Overall we believe that the opportunity for one-on-one conversations with our users is too invaluable to pass up.
It would give us deep insights into what our users truly think which is something that may be missed in other methods mentioned.

>### Example Interview Questions:
> 1. What would make you feel confident participating in a skill exchange with someone you don’t know?
> 2. Walk me through how you would ideally find someone with a skill you need at Flinders University.
> 3. What features and services would make you come back and use the website again, rather than just once?

## Surveys
Just like interviews surveys have a long history of being one of primary methods of gaining feedback on a product. 
But unlike interviews surveys are typically less personal and more general than interviews, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing.
Whilst a survey can't go as indepth as some other research methods it is a great tool for gaining a more general consensus about user opinions on a larger scale.
What surveys lack in personalisation they make up for in shear volume and ease of creation.
In terms of timeline we can see something similar to interviews with the total length being roughly one month given by:
- 1 week for planning and writing.
- 1-2 weeks for conducting the surveys.
- 1 week to compile and analyse the results.

Surveys can be effectively used at multiple stages of the development cycle to gain quick feedback on new features whilst also being used in a more general user sentiment context as well.
>### Example Survey Questions:
> 1. How would you rate the overall Skill Exchange experience here on FUSS: Rate 1-5 (Would be asked after a successful order).
> 2. Could you please provide any feedback on the overall user experience on FUSS: Open ended (Could be asked at the end of all surveys as a sort of 'catch-all').
> 3. What would be the likelihood of you reusing FUSS in the future: Slider with multiple options.

## Usability Tests
Usability tests will help the development team bridge together technical functionality alongside delivering on project goals.
These tests will give us the opportunity to test a variety of features/elements in a way that won't negatively effect the entire userbase.
These tests will be running during the prototype/early development stages which will helpful in finding issues early that could cause big pains downstream.
It will also give developers an insight into how a non-technical person naturally navigates our site and could lead to interesting discoveries around our target users existing mental model.
Time frame for usability tests is similar to other research methods taking approximately one month given by:
- 1 week for planning and writing the tests.
- 1 week for running the tests.
- 1-2 weeks for analysis and interpretation of results.

We believe that usability tests fill the gap that our previous two research methods have left in terms of user feedback.

## Card Sorting
Card sorting is an exercise where participants are given topics on cards and are then asked to sort those cards into groups that are meaningful to them.
This technique could help the development team uncover previously unknown connections between themes and topics and to what user groups they provide the most meaning to.
Our development team can use this information to more carefully curate features for specific user groups based on this exercise.
A drawback is that it may be difficult choosing these topics initially but our previously mentioned research methods may help with narrowing down these topics.
A typical timeframe for this exercise is yet again around one month given by:
- 1 week to plan and prepare.
- 1 week to conduct the exercises.
- 1-2 weeks for analysis and interpretation of results.

We believe this research method will be most useful when used alongside and with the previously mentioned methods.
Card sorting is a unique way to try and get meaningful information about our different user groups, but it will help us truly understand the needs, wants and pains of our different user groups.
>### Example Topics for Card Sorting:
> - Post a skill I can offer.
> - Browse for skills I would like to use.
> - Academic tutoring.
> - Creative skills.
> - Technical skills.
> - Create/update my profile.
> - Show my available skills that I offer.
> - Display wanted/seeking skills.
> - Moderation of user content.
> - Safe dispute system.
