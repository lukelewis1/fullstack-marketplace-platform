# Test Plan
To evaluate the FUSS website, a usability test was created and conducted to gain feedback from five different participants.
The goal of these tests was to gain data and insights on how a user would interact with five different core features and functionalities within the FUSS website.
With the primary goal being to see what parts of the site users may struggle to intuitively use or to identify any bugs or unintended features.

Users will be asked to perform the following five tasks:
1. Posting a Skill/Service on FUSS
    - Login
    - Navigate to skill posting area
    - Fill out the form
    - Post the skill
2. As an Admin Deleting a User
    - Login as an admin
    - Navigate to the user management section of the dashboard
    - Delete the user
3. Signing up for a New Account
    - Choose the signup option at login page
    - Fill out the form
    - Sign in with the newly created account credentials
4. Booking a Skill/Service
    - Login
    - Navigate to skill search area
    - Select the skill/service you want to book
    - Select an appropriate time slot
    - Confirm purchase
5. Confirming Skill/Service Completion and Leaving a Review
    - Login
    - Navigate to the skill bookings area
    - Click the confirmation of service completion button
    - Leave a review and submit

Tests will be performed under the supervision of a group member who will record observations as the user progresses through the tasks as well as timing the users' total time to complete the test.
Users will fill out a pre-test questionnaire before starting any tasks to gage demographic and technical ability information.
After each task users will be asked two single ease questions on a scale of 1–7, then, after all five tasks are complete, they will answer a System Usability Scale survey consisting of 10 questions on a scale of 1–5.
There will also be an option for additional comments at the end, but users will not have to answer this section if they don't want to.

Users will not need to set up the website on their own machine, a machine will be provided with necessary pre-test scripts and initialization already setup.
Users will be given a copy of the test where they will fill out the pre-test questions, single ease questions, SUS questions and other comments as they complete the test.
